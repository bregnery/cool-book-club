  As the header says, this page is "under construction" - like all of us. And it is
  with great fortune that we have books to help us along the way.  I would not 
  consider myself formally trained as a literary critic but in middle and high school at
  <a href="http://www.ccrsk12.org/">Chazy Central Rural School</a>,
  we had to read like 600 pages each quarter and keep a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TEeGIGMVGJrflJvFlZSEhctMZ4ur1D5g/view">summar reading log</a>
  were grilled on it - it's not my first time "around the block", as one may say.

  in the case that you should not bother, and a soft upper bound of 10.

   <li>12 Rules for Life : An antidote to chaos - Jordan Petersen (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REjUkEj1O_0">An intense talk about a cute kids book</a>)</li>

     Review : The title is unfortunate and doesn't do this book justice.  It gives the
     impression that you are diving into some mopey
     self-help book from an academic Tony Robbins written for mid-career, lost souls.  In reality,
     Petersen explores the Yin and Yang boundary between order and chaos and how we are obligated as humans
     to search for and support order while embracing chaos as a means of growth.  He ties together history, literature,
     science and religion, and contemporary living in a fascinating way.  Each chapter
     unfolds like a walk through some dense wood, as some point getting so engulfed in the
     immediate story ahead of us (he really likes bringing up the soviet gulags, the masculine/feminine
     and (yes) Jesus) that you feel like you have almost lost him but then ... you emerge on the 
     other side, the brush clears and you are lifted into some clear and enlightened place.
     I walked away from each chapter with the start of a meditation. And the author, Petersen,
     is Canadian, so I somehow was biased to think he was well-intentioned and kind the whole time.

     Review : If the "12 Rules" was like eating chicken soup (for the soul), then this was like eating those hummus potato chips that are seemingly healthy at face value, and then you look at the label.  It tasted good and was entertaining the entire while, but didn't leave me with a sense of guru enlightenment that I think the author wanted.  There was a lot of sex scenes, both explicit and left to the imagination, and the core message of the book was largely slanted towards discovering ones feminine and folding it more wholly into your life.  Now, while I do think this is important regardless of gender, this was difficult to relate to in some respects (e.g. at one point, her lover speaks to her vagina).  This was accompanied by a more gender-neutral message about not orienting ones perspective on life towards artificial goals to be achieved and "checked off" that will help win the approval of others.  I think this would be a very admirable goal in and of itself to achieve - to seek for approval from internal forces rather than external.  It was a very easy read before bead that required little thought and animated a number of ski destinations throughout the world that I would now like to visit.  I recommend it to anyone needing and easy read.
